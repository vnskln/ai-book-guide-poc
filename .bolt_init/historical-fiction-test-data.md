# Historical Fiction Reader - Test Data

## User Preferences (Plain Text)
```
I'm passionate about historical fiction that immerses me in different time periods with rich, accurate details. I particularly enjoy novels set during World War II, Tudor England, and Ancient Rome. I appreciate complex characters based on historical figures and stories that blend real events with fictional narratives. I prefer books with political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and cultural insights. I dislike science fiction and fantasy elements in my historical reads. I read mainly in English and occasionally in French.
